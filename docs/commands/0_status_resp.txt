1       'Get Status' response
2-3     out     :   Each bit set indicates whether an output is on.
                        Maximum number of outputs is 14.
                        Bits 1-8 of byte 3 correspond to the outputs 1-8 of the
                        control panel.
                        Bits 1-6 of byte 2 correspond to the outputs 9-14 of the
                        control panel.
                        Bits 7-8 of byte 2 are not used.
4-5     zone    :   Each bit set indicates whether a zone is triggered.
                        Maximum number of zones is 16.
                        Bits 1-8 of byte 4 correspond to the zones 1-8 of the
                        control panel.
                        Bits 1-8 of byte 5 correspond to the zones 9-16 of the
                        control panel.
6-7     en      :   Each bit set indicates whether a zone is enabled (only
                        applied when the mode of the alarm is set to `STAY`, as
                        in this mode is possible to have only a subset of zones
                        enabled).
                        Bits 1-8 of byte 6 correspond to the zones 1-8 of the
                        control panel.
                        Bits 1-8 of byte 7 correspond to the zones 9-16 of the
                        control panel.
8-9     XX      :   Unknown and not used bytes.
10      area    :   Indicates whether the stay status as well as the away
                        status of the control panel is enabled for each area.
                        Maximum number if areas is 4.
                        Bits 1-4 correspond to the away status of the areas 1-4
                        Bits 5-8 correspond to the stay status of the areas 5-8
11      s/h   :   Indicate the status of the siren (1 bit) + the current hours.
                        Bit 6 if set mean the siren is triggered.
                        Bits 0-4 represents the hours (0h-23h)
                        Other bits are not used and thus unknown.
12      m   :   Indicate the current minutes.
                        Bits 0-5 represents the minutes (0m-59m).
                        Other bits are not used and thus unknown.
